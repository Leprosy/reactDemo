# reactDemo
A little ReactJS demo I did on my spare time.

## Dependencies

You just need `git`, `node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine.

## Installation

* Clone the repo using the command `git clone git@github.com:Leprosy/reactDemo.git`.
* On the created directory, run `npm install`.
* Then, run `npm run start` to start a server.
* On your browser, go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the demo app.
